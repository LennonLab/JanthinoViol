* **PWTT** = colony count of white with the predation assay that contained only purple Janthino. This was a control.
* **WPTT** = colony count of purple with the predation assay that contained only white Janthino. This was a control.
* **WWTT** = colony count of white with the predation assay that contained only white Janthino. This was a control.
* **PWP** = colony count of purple in the mixed predation assay.
* **PWW** = colony count of white in the mixed predation assay.

####Predation_07232015_WJB.csv

######Headings:
* **PTT** = ratio of purple to the total in the purple-only control.
* **PW** = ratio of purple to the total in the mixed, experimental cultures.
* **WTT** = ratio of purple to the total in the white-only control.

#####Headings:
* **PLB** = purple in LB.
* **WLB** = white in LB.
* **PLBW** = purple in LB with tryptophan added.
* **WLBW** = white in LB with tryptophan added.
* **PLBY** = purple in LB with glycerol added.
* **WLBY** = white in LB with glycerol added.
* **PLBYW** = purple in LB with both glycerol and tryptophan added.
* **WLBYW** = white in LB with both glycerol and tryptophan added.
