WWTT is for the colony count of white with the predation assay that contained only white Janthino. This was a control.
PWP is the colony count of purple in the mixed predation assay.
PWW is the colony count of white in the mixed predation assay.

Headings:
PTT is the ratio of purple to the total in the purple-only control.
PW is the ratio of purple to the total in the mixed, experimental cultures.
